I tried to do this with as few dependencies as possible so I could focus on Mocha's role.  In production I'd also be  using the [Webpack](karma test runner) (to ease working with multiple  Javascript modules), [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to automate Tasks.",
